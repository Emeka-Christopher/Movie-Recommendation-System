# Movie-Recommendation-System
Recommendation System for Netflix movies

# Introduction
This repository showcases my learning of the movie recommendation engine using TFIDF algorithm. The following tasks were carried out:
- Exploratory data analysis: An exploratory data analysis to make sense of the dataset
- Data Preparation: Preparing and loading data for the recommender algorithm
- Model Building: Building models for content based filtering and collaborative filtering

# Algorithms
- Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF): Simple similarity-based algorithm for content-based recommendations with text datasets.
